Upgrading existing versions
===========================

.. warning:: Be aware that some upgrades are not reversible, meaning that the data directory may be changed so that it is no longer compatible with older versions of GeoServer. See :ref:`datadir_migrating` for more details.

The general GeoServer upgrade process is as follows:

#. Back up the current data directory. This can involve simply copying the directory to an additional place.

#. Make sure that the current data directory is external to the application (not located inside the application file structure).

   Check the GeoServer Server status page to double check the data directory location.

#. Make a note of any extensions you have installed.

   * The GeoServer :menuselection:`About --> Server Status` page provides a :guilabel:`Modules` tab listing the modules installed.
   * Some extensions include more than one module, as an example the WPS extension is listed as :file:`gs-wps-core` and :file:`gs-web-wps`.

#. Uninstall the old version and install the new version.
   
   * Download :website:`maintenance <release/maintain>` release to update existing installation
   * Download :website:`stable <release/stable>` release when ready to upgrade
   
#. Be sure to download and install each extension used by your prior installation.

#. Make sure that the new installation continues to point to the same data directory used by the previous version.

Notes on upgrading specific versions
------------------------------------

Disk Quota HSQL DB usage (GeoServer 2.23 and newer)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of GeoServer 2.23, H2 DB support will be replaced with HSQL DB for Tile Caching / Disk Quota store.

* H2 option under "Disk quota store type" and "Target database type" is replaced with HSQL.
* The default store type will be in-process HSQL.
* Existing installations with in-process H2 selection will automatically be migrated to in-process HSQL. Old H2 database files will remain in ``gwc/diskquota_page_store_h2/`` under the data directory. You may delete those or leave them for a possible downgrade.
* Important: Existing installations with external H2 database selection will not be migrated automatically. You will get an error message at startup and disk quota will be disabled, unless you use a plugin/extension with H2 dependency. But other features of GeoServer will keep working. You can go to Disk Quota page and configure an external HSQL database or switch to in-process HSQL. In case you want to keep using H2 as an in-process/external database, you can add H2 store plugin or any other extension or plugin that has H2 dependency.
* GeoServer installations with extensions/plugins having H2 dependency will still have H2 option under "Disk quota store type" and "Target database type".

Remote requests control (GeoServer 2.22 and newer)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of GeoServer 2.22, remote requests control has been added, but disabled by default, in GeoServer. You should consider enabling it and providing safe urls that will be allowed.

When enabled, this feature allows administrators to control which remote requests are allowed to be made to GeoServer. When you first enable it, no authorizations are included, thus GeoServer will deny remote requests originating from user interaction. In particular, the following use cases are affected:

* WMS operations with remotely fetch styles (``sld`` parameter) and style referencing remote icons (in general, icons outside of the data directory).
  As a reminder, when a remote icon is not found, GeoServer will fall back to a default icon, a gray square with a black border.
* WMS "feature portrayal" with dynamic remote WFS references provided in the request (``REMOTE_OWS_TYPE`` and ``REMOTE_OWS_URL`` parameters).
* WPS remote inputs via either GET or POST request (e.g., remote GeoJSON file source).

The list of locations that are safe to contact can be configured using the :ref:`security_urlchecks` page.


Log4J Upgrade (GeoServer 2.21 and newer)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of GeoServer 2.21, the logging system used by GeoServer has been upgraded from Log4J 1.2 to Log4J 2.

* GeoServer now uses :file:`xml` files for the built-in logging profiles (previously :file:`properties` files were used).

* The built-in logging profiles are upgraded with :file:`xml` files:

  | :file:`DEFAULT_LOGGING.xml`
  | :file:`DEFAULT_LOGGING.properties.bak`
  
  
* A backup of the prior :file:`properties` files are created during the upgrade process. If you had previously made any customizations to a built-in profiles these backup files may be used as a reference when customizing the xml file.

* Log4J 2 does have the ability to read Log4j 1.2 properties files although not all features are supported.

  Any custom :file:`properties` files you created will continue to be available for use.
  
* If necessary you can recover a customization you performed to a built-in logging profile by restoring to a different filename. To recover a customization from :file:`PRODUCTION_LOGGING.properties.bak` rename the file to  :file:`PRODUCTION_LOGGING.properties.bak` to :file:`CUSTOM_LOGGING.properties`.

* If you never plan to customize the built-in logging profiles the ``UPDATE_BUILT_IN_LOGGING_PROFILES=true`` system property will always ensure you have our latest recommendation.

JTS Type Bindings (GeoServer 2.14 and newer)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of GeoServer 2.14, the output produced by :ref:`REST <rest>` featuretype and structured coverage requests using a different package name (``org.locationtech`` instead of ``com.vividsolutions``) for geometry type bindings, due to the upgrade to JTS (Java Topology Suite) 1.16.0. For example:

Before::

    ...
    <attribute>
      <name>geom</name>
      <minOccurs>0</minOccurs>
      <maxOccurs>1</maxOccurs>
      <nillable>true</nillable>
      <binding>com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.Point</binding>
    </attribute>
    ...

After::

    ...
    <attribute>
      <name>geom</name>
      <minOccurs>0</minOccurs>
      <maxOccurs>1</maxOccurs>
      <nillable>true</nillable>
      <binding>org.locationtech.jts.geom.Point</binding>
    </attribute>
    ...


Any REST clients which rely on this binding information should be updated to support the new names.

GeoJSON encoding (GeoServer 2.6 and newer)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of GeoServer 2.6, the GeoJSON produced by the WFS service no longer uses a non-standard encoding for the CRS. To re-enable this behavior for compatibility purposes, set ``GEOSERVER_GEOJSON_LEGACY_CRS=true`` as a system property, context parameter, or environment variable.
