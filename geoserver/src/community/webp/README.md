# WebP WMS image output format extension

This module adds [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) as WMS image output format.

Because native libraries are used, not all platforms are supported. The plugin is based on [Java ImageIO WebP support](https://github.com/gotson/webp-imageio), here you can find further information.
